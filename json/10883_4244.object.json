Sponsored by SAGARPA\u2019s international strategic component for increasing wheat performance, under the Sustainable Modernization of Traditional Agriculture Program (MasAgro); and CRP WHEAT. The event covers innovative methods to significantly raise wheat yield potential, including making photosynthesis more efficient, improving adaptation of flowering to diverse environments, addressing the\r\nphysical processes involved in lodging, and physiological and molecular breeding. The workshop represents the current research of the MasAgro TRIGO project and CRP WHEAT that involves scientists working on all continents to strategically integrate research components in a common breeding platform, there by speeding the delivery to farmers of new wheat genotypes.",
