        "value": "Zero tillage planting of wheat after rice has been the main success in the quest for resource-conserving technologies that can save water, reduce production costs and improve production in the Indo?Gangetic Plains, the cereal bowl of South Asia. Binomial logit models are used to assess the structural factors associated with its adoption in the rice?wheat systems of India?s Haryana state and Pakistan?s Punjab province. Zero tillage adoption is closely associated with a more favourable resource base and rice?wheat specialization in both study areas. This calls for a closer consideration of equity implications in future research and development.",
