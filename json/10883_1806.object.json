        "value": "One hundred lines derived from 14 wheat landraces collected in Mexico were characterized in relation to spike and grain morphology and HMW-glutenin subunit composition. Up to seven botanical varieties were identified among these materials based in four morphological traits. The remaining nine morphological traits showed wide variation. The allelic variation at the Glu-1 loci was wide, although showed a clear risk of genetic erosion due to the low frequency of some alleles. These genotypes could be used as genetic resources to improve important biotic and abiotic traits as well as to widen genetic diversity controlling the HMW glutenin subunit composition of common wheat",
