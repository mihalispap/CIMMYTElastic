        "value": "Stay green or delayed senescence is considered to play a crucial role in grain development in wheat when assimilates are limited.Weidentified three QTLs for stay green on the chromosomes 1AS, 3BS and 7DS using a recombinant inbred (RI) population developed by making crosses between the stay green parent ?Chirya 3? and non-stay green ?Sonalika?. The RI lines were evaluated in natural field conditions for 2 years in replicated trial. The QTL on chromosome 1A was identified in both the years, while the QTLs on 3BS and 7DS were identified only in 1st and 2nd year, respectively. The QTLs explained up to 38.7% of phenotypic variation in a final simultaneous fit. The alleles for higher stay green values derived from the stay green parent ?Chirya 3?. The QTLs were named as QSg.bhu-1A, QSg.bhu-3B and QSg.bhu-7D. The QTL QSg.bhu-3B and QSg.bhu-7D were placed in the 3BS9-0.57-0.78 and 7DS5-0.36-0.61 deletion bins, respectively.",
