        "value": "The genetic basis of heterosis for grain yield and its components was investigated at the single- and two-locus levels using molecular markers with an immortalized F2 (IF2) population, which was developed by pair crosses among recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the elite maize hybrid Yuyu22. Mid-parent heterosis of each cross in the IF2 population was used to map heterotic quantitative trait loci. A total of 13 heterotic loci (HL) were detected. These included three HL for grain yield, seven for ear length, one for ear row number and two for 100-kernel weight. A total of 143 digenic interactions contributing to mid-parent heterosis were detected at the two-locus level involving all three types of interactions (additive × additive = AA, additive × dominance = AD or DA, dominance × dominance = DD). There were 25 digenic interactions for grain yield, 36 for ear length, 31 for ear row number and 51 for 100-kernel weight. Altogether, dominance effects of HL at the single-locus level as well as AA interactions played an important role in the genetic basis of heterosis for grain yield and its components in Yuyu22.",
