        "value": "Molecular breeding (MB) holds great promise for developing countries. However, the developing countries are hardly homogeneous in its implementation. Whilst newly industrialised countries routinely use several MB applications and are exploring the latest approaches, developing countries with mid-level economies are testing marker applications and taking initial steps towards adopting MB in day-to-day breeding. Various bottlenecks still impede adoption in these countries. Limited human resources and inadequate field infrastructure remain major challenges, although through virtual platforms aided by the information and communication technology revolution, breeders now have better access to genomic resources, advanced laboratory services, and robust analytical and data management tools. These developments are bound to have impact crop improvement in developing countries.",
