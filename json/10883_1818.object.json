        "value": "We evaluated a large collection of Tos17 mutant panel lines for their reaction to three different races of Magnaporthe oryzae and identified a lesion mimic mutant, NF4050-8, that showed lesions similar to naturally occurring spl5 mutant and enhanced resistance to all the three blast races tested. Nested modified-AFLP using Tos17-specific primers and southern hybridization experiments of segregating individuals indicated that the lesion mimic phenotype in NF4050-8 is most likely due to a nucleotide change acquired during the culturing process and not due to Tos17 insertion per se. Inheritance and genetic analyses in two japonica × indica populations identified an overlapping genomic region of 13 cM on short arm of chromosome 7 that was linked with the lesion mimic phenotype. High-resolution genetic mapping using 950 F3 and 3,821 F4 plants of NF4050-8 × CO39 delimited a 35 kb region flanked by NBARC1 (5.262 Mb) and RM8262 (5.297 Mb), which contained 6 ORFs; 3 of them were ?resistance gene related? with typical NBS?LRR signatures. One of them harbored a NB?ARC domain, which had been previously demonstrated to be associated with cell death in animals. Microarray analysis of NF4050-8 revealed significant up-regulation of numerous defense/pathogenesis-related genes and down-regulation of heme peroxidase genes. Real-time PCR analysis of WRKY45 and PR1b genes suggested possible constitutive activation of a defense signaling pathway downstream of salicylic acid but independent of NH1 in these mutant lines of rice.",
