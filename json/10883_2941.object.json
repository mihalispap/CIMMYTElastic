        "value": "In this study, the effect of temperatures on the incubation duration of the cereal cyst nematode cysts, Heterodera avenae (Wollenweber, 1924) and determining of the optimum methods and materials was investigated under in-vitro conditions. The effect of tempratures on incubation duration of Heterodera avenae cysts was studied on two different incubation stages. First incubation exposured to all cysts was set up 66 days at 4ºC after each samples transfered different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25ºC). The cumulative hatching percent was significantly effected by different temperatures at the end of 252 days. Hatching was greater at lower temperatures (5, 10 15 ºC) compared to at higher temperatures of (20, 25ºC) ranging between 46.7, 82.3 and 45.9 % vs and 30.7 and 19.0%, respectively. Although the highest cumulative hatching of 82.3% was obtained at a constant 10ºC at 252 days, the lowest cumulative hatching of 19.0% was obtained to 25ºC at 252 days. The most suitable soil type for the in-vitro conditions was found the sandy soil (70 % sand: 29% field soil: 1% organic matter), best inoculation rate was 2,5 second stage juveniles  per gram soil and inoculation time at planting day.",
