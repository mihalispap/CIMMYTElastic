        "value": "Integrated crop livestock production systems are among the principal modes of livelihood in rural Zimbabwe. Nonetheless, the dynamics in each of the different components in such systems and the potential impact of technologies that enhance integration of these components at household level is hardly known. Concomitantly, CIMMYT, ICRISAT, ILRI and the government of Zimbabwe have designed and started to implement a project entitled \u201cIntegrating crops and livestock for improved food security and livelihoods in rural Zimbabwe\u201d. The project is funded by the Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and aims at increasing agricultural production through better integration\nof crop and livestock production and improved market functioning that will contribute to  enhanced resilience of communities most vulnerable to food insecurity in rural Zimbabwe. This survey is designed to generate baseline information that will establish references for different measurements to be done in order to develop household typologies and quantify impact of the interventions to be made by or due to the project.",
