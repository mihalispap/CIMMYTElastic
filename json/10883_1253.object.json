        "value": "Part 1 of this report (which is a continuation of CIMMYT's World Wheat Facts and Trends series under a new name) explores issues related to the development and adoption of no-till technology, especially in small-scale agriculture. It describes no-till's special features, the innovation systems through which the technology evolves, a new framework for the socioeconomic study of the development and adoption of no-till, and the methodological difficulties involved in measuring no-till's benefits and adoption. This information provides the context for a series of six case studies of no-till experiences among small-scale farmers in Latin America, Africa, and Asia (and largely in wheat cropping systems). Part 1 concludes by discussing key factors conditioning the effectiveness of no-til1 programs for small-scale farmers, including the implications for national and international agricultural research. Part 2 documents that wheat yield potential has grown more rapidly in marginal compared to favorable environments in recent years, explores the reasons for this growth, and discusses the implications for future wheat breeding research for marginal areas. Part 3 tracks current and future trends in the global wheat market, with special attention to policy in the United States, European Union, and China. Part 4 provides statistics on wheat production, consumption, yields, and other variables.",
