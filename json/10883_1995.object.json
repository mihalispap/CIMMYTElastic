        "value": "It is ironic that fanning systems research and extension (FSRE), long accustomed lo condemning conventional agricultural research for having limited impact on farmers, is becoming increasingly vulnerable lo the lame charge. FSRE practitioners can no longer ignore questions of adoption and impact This paper discusses methods for assessing the impact of FSRE programs, with emphasis on three levels of analysis: monitoring farmer adoption of new technology; estimating economic returns lo investment in agricultural research, including FSRE; and using general equilibrium analysis lo examine the effects of widespread fanner adoption on non-adopting populations. Of these three levels, the first is fundamental. Yet even that one has been largely ignored by FSRE practitioners. The third level has never been used by FSRE practitioners, and is unlikely lo be, unless FSRE can be shown to be responsible for major changes in productivity over large areas.",
