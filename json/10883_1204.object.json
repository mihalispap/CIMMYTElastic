Beginning with a summary of progress over the past 15 years, the report proceeds to describe the production and characterization of wide hybrids based on interspecific and intergeneric crosses; production of polyhaploid wheats using maize and Tripsacum; and applications of tissue culture, biochemical markers, and molecular markers in wheat wide crosses. The concluding section provides information on future directions for wheat wide crosses work at CIMMYT",
