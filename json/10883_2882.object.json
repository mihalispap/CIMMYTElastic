        "value": "The improvement of kernel morphology traits is an important goal in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding programs because of their close relationship with grain yield and milling quality. The aim of this study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for kernel morphology traits using 240 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between the non-1BL.1RS translocation cv. PH 82-2 and the 1BL.1RS translocation cv. Neixiang 188, grown in six environments in China. Inclusive composite interval mapping identified 71 main-effect QTL on 16 chromosomes for seven kernel morphology traits measured by digital imaging, viz. kernel length, width, perimeter, area, shape factor, factor form-density and width/length ratio. Each of these loci explained from 2.6 to 28.2% of the phenotypic variation. Eight QTL clusters conferring the largest effects on kernel weight and kernel morphology traits were detected on chromosomes 1BL.1RS (2), 2A, 4A, 4B, 6B, 6D and 7A. Fourteen epistatic QTL were identified for all kernel morphology traits except kernel width/length ratio, involving 24 main-effect QTL distributed on 13 chromosomes, and explaining 2.5?8.3% of the phenotypic variance. Five loci, viz. Sec-1 on 1BL.1RS, Glu-B1 on 1BL, Xcfe53 on 2A, Xwmc238 on 4B, and Xbarc174 on 7A, were detected consistently across environments, and their linked DNA markers may be used for marker-assisted selection in breeding for improved wheat kernel traits and grain yield.",
