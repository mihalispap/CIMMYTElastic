        "value": "Dry seeded rice (DSR) is becoming an attractive option\r\nfor farmers in the Cauvery Delta Zone (CDZ) due to the\r\nelimination of the labor requirement for nursery preparation\r\nand maintenance, pulling out and transport of seedlings,\r\nand transplanting. Because the soil is not puddled, DSR\r\nalso has a lower water requirement for crop establishment.\r\nFurthermore, the total crop cycle is shorter by 10âˆ’15 days\r\nbecause of the absence of transplanting shock. These\r\nfeatures of DSR are of major importance for the Cauvery\r\nDelta (see below) because of the increasing scarcity of\r\nwater for irrigation in the area. DSR can be readily adopted\r\nby small farmers as well as large farmers, provided that the\r\nrequired machinery is locally available (e.g., through custom\r\nhire). Best practice involves using a 2- or 4-wheel tractordrawn\r\ndrill to seed in rows in dry or slightly moist soil.",
