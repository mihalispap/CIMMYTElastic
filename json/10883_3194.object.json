        "value": "Maize is fourth most important food crop of Afghanistan. The country has been dependent on imported food grain to meet its domestic needs. Maize has vast scope to contribute to Afghan food security as historically Afghanistan has been producing larger quantities of maize than presently. Having added millions to its population, Afghanistan has even an enhanced capacity to consume even bigger maize harvests. Open pollinated varieties are definitely need of the hour since poor farming community can not afford higher seed and input costs of hybrid maize and costs associated with new seed purchase every year. Zoodras, an early maturing, high yielding maize open pollinated variety has been released in Afghanistan and will serve as a profitable option allowing double cropping to increase farm level productivity.",
