The publication's three main sections touch on all aspects of the handling of open-pollinated varieties, which are by far the most commonly grown maize materials in developing countries, but have been relatively neglected in the literature on seed production. Following an introduction that discusses the appropriateness of open-pollinated varieties for developing countries and changes in",
