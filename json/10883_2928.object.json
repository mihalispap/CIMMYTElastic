        "value": "The effect of high and low molecular weight glutenin subunits on viscoelastic properties of wheat kernels was investigated using creep tests with generalized Kelvin¨CVoigt model (r2 ¡Ö 0.94; P < 0.0001). Glu-A1, Glu-B1 and Glu-D1 affected the creep coefficients in Glu-1 loci. Regarding LMW-GS, the locus Glu-A3 had highest influence on creep followed by Glu-B3; Glu-D3 did not showed differences. In general, the modulus of elasticity E0 ¡Ö 242 MPa and viscosity was ¦Ì0 ¡Ö 1.6 ¡Á 107 MPa¡¤s. Higher elastic moduli and viscosity were found in HMW-GS and LMW-GS of good quality compared to the poor quality performance genotypic groups. Samples with subunit Glu-A1 null presented lower elastic modulus and viscosity compared to Glu-A1 1 and 2&#8727;. Glu-B1 13 + 16 presented higher elastic modulus and viscosity, which is associated with good quality performance. The elastic moduli, especially E0 were positively correlated with SDS-volume and rheological properties. This methodology can be applied to few kernels is easy, rapid, and nondestructive.",
