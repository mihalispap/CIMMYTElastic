        "value": "?Red Ruby? (Reg. No. CV-1072, PI 662035) soft red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was developed by the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station and released in 2007 via an exclusive licensing agreement through Michigan State University Technologies. Red Ruby was selected from the cross Pioneer ?2552?/Pioneer ?2737W? made in 1995. The original objective of the cross was the development of high-yielding soft white winter wheats with good end-use quality. Although soft white wheat is a very valuable commodity in Michigan, currently more soft red wheat is produced, and therefore there is also a high demand for improved soft red wheats. Red Ruby is a high-yielding, F4?derived line with the original experimental number E1007R. A bulk breeding method was used to develop the cultivar, with bulk selections in early generations, followed by a headrow selection in the F5 and bulking again in later generations. In addition to standard yield-test criteria, milling and baking performances also were considered for selection. Red Ruby was released because of its high yield, high test weight, and red grain color. Red Ruby is well adapted to Michigan",
