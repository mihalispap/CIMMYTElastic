        "value": "This report analyzes crop-livestock interactions in maize-based, mixed farming systems in the Rift Valley and the\r\nwestern, mid-highland areas of Ethiopia. These areas are known for their maize-based crop-livestock farming\r\nsystems. Cross sectional survey data collected from 300 households in the Rift Valley area and among 199\r\nhouseholds in the western, mid-highlands were used for the analysis. The results show that there is a strong\r\ninteraction between crop and livestock production at the household level. Crop residue produced from major\r\ncereal crops is used as livestock feed. Compared to other cattle types, households keep relatively larger numbers\r\nof oxen, which are the only sources of draft power in crop production. Manure used in cereal crop production,\r\nmainly for maize, comes from livestock. Generally, existing trends indicate a strong complementarity between\r\ncrop and livestock production at the household level.",
