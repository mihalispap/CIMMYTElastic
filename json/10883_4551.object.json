        "value": "Dry seeded rice (DSR) is becoming an attractive option\r\nfor farmers as it has a much lower labor requirement\r\nand establishment cost than manually transplanted rice.\r\nLabor for transplanting rice has become scarce and costly\r\nbecause laborers are shifting from agriculture to industry,\r\npublic works, and overseas employment. DSR can be\r\nreadily adopted by small farmers as well as large farmers,\r\nprovided that the required machinery is locally available\r\n(e.g., through custom hire). Best practice involves using a\r\n2- or 4-wheel tractor-drawn drill to seed in rows in nontilled\r\nor dry tilled soil, as for wheat. Because the soil is not\r\npuddled, DSR also has a lower water requirement for crop\r\nestablishment.",
