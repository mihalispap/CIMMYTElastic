        "value": "A major objective of biometrical genetics is to explore the nature of gene action in determining quantitative traits. This also includes determination of the number of major genetic factors or genes responsible for the traits.  Diallel Mating Designs have been designed to deal with the type of genetic experiments that help assess variability in observed quantitative traits arising from genetic factors, environmental factors, and their interactions. Some  Diallel Mating Designs are North Carolina Designs, Line by Tester Designs and Diallel designs.\n\nAGD-R is a set of R programs that performs statistical analyses to calculate Diallel, Line by Tester, North Carolina. AGD-R contains a graphical JAVA interface that helps the user to easily choose input files, which analysis to implement, and which variables to analyze.",
