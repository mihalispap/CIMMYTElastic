Sponsored by SAGARPA\u2019s international  strategic component for increasing wheat performance, under the Sustainable Modernization  of Traditional Agriculture Program (MasAgro); BBSRC, UK; USAID, USA; and GRDC,  Australia.  The event covers innovative methods to significantly raise wheat yield potential, including  making photosynthesis more efficient, improving adaptation of flowering to diverse  environments, addressing the physical processes involved in lodging, and physiological  and molecular breeding. The workshop represents the current research of the International Wheat Yield Consortium that involves scientists working on all continents to strategically integrate research components in a common breeding platform, thereby speeding the delivery to farmers of new wheat genotypes.",
