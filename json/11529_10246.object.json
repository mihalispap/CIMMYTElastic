        "value": "CIMMYT has periodically announced CIMMYT Maize Lines (CMLs). CMLs are carefully selected inbred lines with good general combining ability and a significant number of value-adding traits such as drought tolerance, N use efficiency, acid soil tolerance, resistance to diseases, insects and parasitic weeds. In many instances, they are parental lines of hybrids which have proven successful in one or several maize mega-environments. For each line, there is information about pedigree, heterotic group, disease resistance, breeding program, agronomic characteristics, adaptation group, etc. in this reference table.\n\nAs of September 2015, the Maize Program has released 577 CMLs.\n\nThese CML lines are available at the CIMMYT Maize Germplasm Bank:\nhttp://www.cimmyt.org/en/what-we-do/germplasm-and-seed/obtainseed\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: CIMMYT-DMU@cgiar.org",
