The incidence of polymorphism was 36% for RFLP probes, 20% for RAPD primers, and 42% for AFLP primers. The overall incidence of disturbed segregation was 18%. Linkage relationships at a LOD score of 4.0 and indicated 11 linkage groups. The total map length was  and the map was clearly unsaturated with markers spaced at .
