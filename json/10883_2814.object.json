        "value": "{Objective} The objectives of this study were to characterize the allelic variation at Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 locus in 273 CIMMYT wheat cultivars (lines), evaluate their resistance against stripe rust, leaf rust and powdery mildew, and validate the functional markers for the locus. {Method} A total of 273 CIMMYT wheat genotypes were tested using a STS marker csLV34 and 5 functional markers cssfr1-cssfr5 which were developed based on a 3-bp deletion in the exon 11 of Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 gene, and were tested for stripe rust resistance in fields in Chengdu and CIMMYT, respectively, leaf rust in CIMMYT, and powdery mildew in Beijing. {Result} The results tested by the STS marker csLV34 showed a 96.7% identity to those of cssfr1-cssfr5. Of the 273 lines, 43 were characterized to have Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 resistance gene, with partial resistance against stripe rust, leaf rust and powdery mildew in field across different environments. {Conclusion} The 5 functional markers (cssfr1-cssfr5) could be used to detect the allelic variants in Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 locus, and 43 CIMMYT lines with Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 may be used in wheat breeding targeting for stripe rust, leaf rust and powdery mildew resistance with marker-assisted selection of cssfr3, cssfr4 and cssfr5.",
