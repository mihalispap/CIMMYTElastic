        "value": "Wheat end-use product quality is highly influenced by the composition and quantity of high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS and LMW-GS). In the present study, 224 Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines were characterised for the HMW-GS and LMW-GS with allele-specific PCR markers and sodium-dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The results showed that 56 cultivars (25.0%) carried the allele Glu-D1-1d (Dx5), while 80 cultivars (35.7%) with the allele Glu-B1-2a (By8) produced a 527-bp specific band. Fourteen genotypes (6.3%) with the allele Glu-B1e (Bx20) yielded a 701-bp amplicon with the marker Mar and a 753-bp specific PCR fragment with the marker ZSBy9aF1/R3. Glu-B1h (Bx14+By15) was present in only 1 genotype, and 2 cultivars contained the allele Glu-B1f (Bx13+By16) identified with the marker ZSBy9F2/R2. Four genotypes (1.8%) with the allele Glu-B1-1d (Bx6) gave 695-bp and 830-bp bands, and 5 genotypes (2.2%) with the allele Glu-B1i (Bx17+By18) amplified a 659-bp fragment using the marker Bx. One hundred and six cultivars (47.3%) had the allele Glu-B1-2b (By9), amplifying a 663-bp fragment with the marker ZSBy9aF1/R3; 34 genotypes (15.8%) contained the allele Glu-B3d, generating a 662-bp PCR fragment with the marker gluB3d. Fifteen cultivars (7.0%) with the allele Glu-B3b yielded 1570-bp and 750-bp PCR amplicons with the markers gluB3b and gluB3bef, respectively. The allele Glu-B3h was found in 7 cultivars, generating a 1022-bp PCR fragment with the marker gluB3h. The genotypes detected by SDS-PAGE were mostly consistent with those identified by molecular markers, confirming the utility of the molecular markers. The information for the HMW-GS and LMW-GS in Chinese wheat cultivars will be useful in wheat breeding programs.",
