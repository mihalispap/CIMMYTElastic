        "value": "arbon isotope discrimination (&#8710;13C) is considered as an index of leaf-level water use efficiency, an important objective for plant breeders seeking to conserve water resources. We report in rice a genetic analysis for &#8710;13C, leaf structural parameters, gas exchange, stomatal conductance, and leaf abscisic acid (ABA) concentrations. Doubled haploid and recombinant inbred populations, both derived from the cross IR64 Ã— Azucena, were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis following greenhouse experiments. &#8710;13C QTLs on the long arms of chromosomes 4 and 5 were colocalized with QTLs associated with leaf blade width, length, and flatness, while a QTL cluster for &#8710;13C, photosynthesis parameters, and ABA was observed in the near-centromeric region of chromosome 4. These results are consistent with phenotypic correlations and suggest that genetic variation in carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance contribute to the genetic variation for &#8710;13C in this population.",
