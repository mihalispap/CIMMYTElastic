        "value": "Asia's maize (Zea mays L.) sector has shown rapid growth during the last few decades. This article reviews the evolving maize sector in Asia, focusing on the eight main maize-producing countries: China, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Taken together, these eight Asian countries now produce 98% of Asia's maize and 26% of global maize but show major geographic variation in maize economy indicators and dynamics. The article flags some of the implications of Asia's maize sector for the poor and the evolving roles for the public and private sectors. Challenges and opportunities to accelerate maize production in Asia are reviewed. There remain significant growth opportunities for maize in Asia, and this calls for an integrated research and development approach to strengthen the innovation pathways needed to sustainably reduce poverty, enhance incomes and conserve natural resources.",
