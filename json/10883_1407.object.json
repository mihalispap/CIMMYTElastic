        "value": "Soil conservation practices were successfully disseminated and adopted among farmers in Guaymango, El Salvador, whereas farmers in two similar areas failed to adopt them. Adoption was successful in Guaymango for two reasons. First, a recommendation was developed that combined both productivity-improving and soil conservation components. Second these components were linked by economic and institutional incentives that encouraged adoption of both components. Issues crucial to long-term success of soil conservation recommendations are discussed, particularly the need for the recommendation to be compatible with the farming system and effective in minimizing soil degradation. Potent-idl implications for research, extension, and policy are examined, with emphasis on technical requirements for developing system-management recommendations embodying productivity and conservation components",
