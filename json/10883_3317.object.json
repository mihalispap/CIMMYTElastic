        "value": "Turkey is ranked among top ten wheat producing countries in the world. Cereal cyst nematodes are considered one of the most damaging plant parasitic nematodes on wheat worldwide. Up to date, the most effective method of controlling this group of nematodes is the use of crop rotation and resistant varieties. The successful development of disease-resistant plants is contingent on knowledge of the pathotypes of the causal agent. In this study, three populations of Heterodera filipjevi (Madzhidov, 1981) Stelter were collected from different locations (Afsin, Elbistan and Yozgat) in Turkey in order to identify their pathotype using ?The International Test Assortment of Cereal Cultivars?. The results showed that two populations gave a similar reaction to the resistant and susceptible varieties. These populations were determined as Ha 33 pathotype which is a new report for Turkey.",
