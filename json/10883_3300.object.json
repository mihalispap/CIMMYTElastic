        "value": "Tan spot caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis is a major wheat disease. DNA of 61 isolates of P.$$tritici-repentis from different cereal growing areas in Algeria were analyzed using amplified fragment$$length polymorphism (AFLP) in order to study the genetic diversity among this population. Initially, 78$$primer combinations were tested, of which 12 were selected and applied to the 61 isolates. There was a$$high genetic diversity in this population of P. tritici-repentis with 61 different haplotypes among the 61$$isolates selected. The Jaccard similarity index range was 1.43 to 68.37%. Cluster analysis showed that,$$clustering of isolates was independent of their race classification, geographic origin, or host plant.$$However, one isolate (Ptr24) that showed a new virulence pattern in our previous race analysis study$$was clearly distinguished from the rest of the population studied. This isolate had not only new$$virulence but also different genetic makeup to other P. tritici-repentis isolates and requires additional$$studies to decipher complete knowledge of host-pathogen interactions for tan spot of wheat.",
