Results showed that weed seed separated at Backi Maglic in all years dominated in the top soil layer, while the lowest quantities were separated from the deepest layer, and that number of weeds declined annually. At Krivaja, the lowest weed seed stocks were found in the top layer, and the highest in the deepest layer. At this locality, number of weed seeds kept rising from season to season, which was the consequence of application of different cultural practices.",
