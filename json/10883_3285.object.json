        "value": "Breeding for resistance to the cereal cyst nematodes (CCN) Heterodera filipjevi (Madzhidov,) Stelter, and H. avenae (Wollenweber) and to the root lesion nematode (RLN) Pratylenchus thornei (Sher & Allen) is presently being undertaken by breeding programs at research institutions in Turkey. This study was carried out to screen for nematode resistance in an advanced spring bread wheat breeding population, 42 lines (F9) developed at CIMMYT in Mexico, by crossing resistant parent the Middle- Eastern landrace AUS4930 7.2 and susceptible parent, the widely adapted, high yielding CIMMYT line, Pastor. The results demonstrate that 31 lines are resistant to P. thornei and 5 lines are resistant to H. filipjevi. Only 4 of these lines (2, 7, 23 and 41) are resistant to both nematodes. Lines 2, 7 and 41 also contain the known resistance gene, Cre1. Although some lines carry the Cre1 gene, they are susceptible to either both or one of these nematodes. There is no association among H. filipjevi, P. thornei and Cre1 resistance due to differences in the resistance region in the plant genome.",
