        "value": "The genetic diversity within wheat breeding programs across Turkey and Kazakhstan was compared with a selection of European cultivars that represented the genetic diversity across eight European countries and six decades of wheat breeding. To focus the measure of genetic diversity on that relevant to disease-resistant phenotypes, nucleotide-binding-site (NBS) profiling was used to detect polymorphisms associated with the NBS motifs found within the NBS - leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class of resistance (R) genes. Cereal-specific NBS primers, designed specifically to the conserved NBS motifs found within cereal R-genes, provided distinct NBS profiles. Although the genetic diversity associated with NBS motifs was only slightly higher within the Eastern wheat genotypes, the NBS profiles produced by Eastern and European wheat lines differed considerably. Structure analysis divided the wheat genotypes into four groups, which compared well with the origin of the wheat genotypes. The highest levels of genetic diversity were seen for the wheat genotypes from the Genetic Resource Collection held in Ankara, Turkey, as wheat genotypes within breeding programs were genetically more similar. The wheat genotypes from Kazakhstan were the most similar to the European cultivars, reflecting the significant number of eastern European cultivars used in the breeding program in Kazakhstan. In general, the NBS profiles suggested that NBS-LRR R-gene usage in winter wheat breeding in Turkey and Kazakhstan differed from that deployed in European cultivars",
