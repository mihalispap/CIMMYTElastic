        "value": "Genetic and kernel texture relationships between Puroindoline b-2 variants 2 and 3 have not been fully established in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Here, 480 F2 plants, derived from three hard spring wheat populations were used to test the segregation of Puroindoline b-2 (Pinb-2) variants 2 and 3. Chi-square analysis indicated that Pinb-2 variants 2 and 3 in all three F2 populations segregated as a single bi-allelic locus, with segregation ratios fitting a 1:2:1 ratio. Using 448 of the 480 plants derived from these three F2 populations, the average SKCS hardness index of plants homozygous for Pinb-2 variant 2 vs. those homozygous for variant 3 was not significantly different (67.5 vs. 67.9). Results indicated that plants with Pina-D1b/Pinb-D1a were on average 10.0 Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS) hardness index units harder than those carrying the Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1b haplotype. In conclusion, Pinb-2 variants 2 and 3 are allelic and exert little effect on kernel texture in hard-kernel T. aestivum germplasm. Further, the designation of Pinb-2v2 and Pinb-2v3 should be changed to Pinb-B2a and Pinb-B2b, respectively. We propose that Pinb-2 variants 1 and 4 of Chinese Spring be designated Pinb-D2a and Pinb-A2a, respectively.",
