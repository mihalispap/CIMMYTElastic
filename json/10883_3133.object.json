        "value": "For in vivo production of doubled haploid (DH) lines in maize, the rate of haploid induction is of crucial importance. Maternal haploid induction depends primarily on the inducer used as a pollinator. However, the source germplasm used as a maternal parent and the environmental conditions for induction may also influence haploid induction and these aspects have not been examined in tropical maize so far. The objectives of our study were to (i) monitor the variation for haploid induction rate (HIR) among diverse source germplasm in tropical maize, (ii) determine the relative importance of general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining abilities for HIR, and (iii) investigate the influence of summer and winter seasons and genotype × season interactions on this trait. Ten inbreds were mated in a half diallel design. The resulting 45 F1 single crosses were pollinated with the haploid inducer hybrid RWS × UH400 during the summer 2008 and winter 2009 seasons in a lowland tropical environment in Mexico. HIR of the single crosses averaged over seasons ranged from 2.90 to 9.66% with an overall mean of 6.74%. Mean HIR was significantly (P < 0.01) higher during the winter (7.37%) than summer season (6.11%). Significant (P < 0.01) variation was observed due to GCA effects of parental inbreds of single crosses but not for SCA, GCA × season and SCA × season interactions. Our study underpins that a higher HIR in tropical maize can be obtained by selecting appropriate source germplasm and undertaking pollination under favorable environmental conditions.",
