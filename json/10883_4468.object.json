        "value": "The Farm Mechanization and Conservation Agriculture for Sustainable Intensification (FACASI) project aims at exploiting the synergies between small-scale-mechanization and Conservation Agriculture. The overall goal of the FACASI project is to improve farm power balance, reduce labour drudgery, and minimize biomass trade-offs in Eastern and Southern Africa through accelerated delivery and adoption of two-wheeled tractor-based technologies by smallholders. \nThis Story Book has been developed to create awareness and demonstrate why the 2-wheel tractor (2WT) is the form of mechanized farm power best adapted to the Eastern and Southern African context. The use of 2WTs in Conservation Agriculture and entrepreneurial business model approaches show the promise for sustainable intensification and upscaling.",
