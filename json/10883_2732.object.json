        "value": "lBL/1RS translocation has been widely used for improving agronomic performance and disease resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), however, it has strong negative effect on processing quality.  To develop a method for 1BL/1RS translocation identification with mixograph parameters, 404 advanced lines from 146 crosses in 2005-2006 (experiment I) and 175 advanced lines and main cultivars of Shandong province (experiment II) in 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 cropping seasons were used in this study. All materials were sown under irrigation condition in a randomized complete design with 1 replication in Jinan. The genetic effect of lBL/lRS translocation on mixograph parameters was investigated. The variations of mixograph parameters under different combinations of the high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and low molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) were also analyzed.  1BL/1RS translocation lines showed significantly shorter mixing time, less bandwidth of peak and bandwidth after 1 min peak, and higher angle of descent and the bandwidth ratio (the ratio of bandwidth of peak/bandwidth after l min peak) in comparison with non-1BL/1RS translocation lines.  It indicated that the lBL/lRS translocation has deleterious effects on mixograph parameters.  Mixograph of the lBL/J RS translocation was characterized with the bandwidth sharply declining and narrowing after l min peak, and increasing the bandwidth ratio, whereas the bandwidth of non-lBL/lRS translocations declined gently after l min peak or had a longer mixing tolerance, and had a little variation about the bandwidth ratio.  Furthermore, 85.2% (experiment I) and 96.8% (experiment II) accuracies were achieved in grouping the Lbl/lRS translocation and non-1BL/1RS translocation on the basis of the band width ratio, i.e., 1BL/1RS translocation line had a value smaller than 1.6.  Although the Glu-B3 alleles showed better quality parameters when HMW-GS 5+10 was presented, it was still the most unfavorable allele on mixograph parameters among all Glu-B3 alleles.  Therefore, mixograph parameters could be used to determine the rheological properties and the presence of 1BL/1RS translocation",
