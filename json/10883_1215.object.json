        "value": "This document describes wheat's origins and the flows of germplasm between various regions of the world. It summarizes some of the tools biological and social scientists use to measure genetic diversity. It examines patterns of bread wheat diversity in farmers' fields and evidence of genetic variation from breeding programs. Findings suggest that the often-invoked dichotomy between the gene-poor North and the gene-rich South has little validity for wheat. Findings also suggest that yield stability, resistance to rusts, pedigree complexity, and the number of modern cultivars in farmers' fields have all increased since the early years of the Green Revolution. Also included is a description of how economists approach the valuation of genetic diversity. Key policy issues for future research are identified. The report concludes with a brief overview of the world wheat situation in 1995/96, followed by selected statistics on production, consumption, and trade for all regions of the world.",
