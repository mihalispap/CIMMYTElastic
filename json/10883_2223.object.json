        "value": "This study employs a heteroscedastic hedonic price model to examine the factors that influence cattle prices in the rural markets of central Ethiopia. The empirical results show that season, market location, class of cattle, body size and age are very important determinants of the cattle price. The relative weight of the phenotypic characteristics of the animals is among the highest of all the factors considered. These preferences at the farmers' and farmer traders' levels are the ones that matter most in shaping the diversity of animals kept at farm level, and the diversity of cattle genetic resources is quite essential for generating or identifying the best suited breeds of cattle, given the livelihood objectives of the target community.",
