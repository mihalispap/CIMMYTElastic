        "value": "Lipoxygenase (LOX) activity is an important factor determining the color of flour and end-use products of wheat. In the present study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for LOX activity in common wheat were mapped using 71 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from a Zhongyou 9507 Ã— CA9632 cross, and SSR markers. Two QTL, QLpx.caas.1AL and QLpx.caas-4B, were identified on chromosomes 1AL and 4B, closely associated with LOX activity. The SSR loci Xwmc312 and Xgwm251 proved to be diagnostic and explained 13.4?25.2% of the phenotypic variance for the 1AL locus and 14.3?27.0% for the 4B locus across four environments. The SSR markers Xgwm251 and Xwmc312 were validated across 198 Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines and showed highly significant (P < 0.01) association with LOX activity. We further established a multiplexed PCR with SSR marker combination Xwmc312/Xgwm251 to test these wheat cultivars and advanced lines. The results suggested that the marker combination Xwmc312/Xgwm251 is efficient and reliable for evaluating LOX activity and can be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for targeting flour color attributes to noodle and other wheat-based products.",
